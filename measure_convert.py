def eGFR_2021_CKD_EPI(sex, age, S_cr, S_cys=None):
    '''
    Calculate the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the 2021 CKD-EPI equation, 
    which takes into account serum creatinine (S_cr) and optionally serum cystatin C (S_cys).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    sex : int
        Binary variable indicating biological sex.
        - 0 : Female
        - 1 : Male
    
    age : float
        Age of the individual in years. 
    
    S_cr : float
        Serum Creatinine in mg/dL, required for all calculations. 
    
    S_cys : float, optional
        Serum Cystatin C in mg/L. If provided, the improved 2021 CKD-EPI equation will be used.
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in ml/min/1.73 mÂ².
    
    Notes
    -----
    The function applies two different equations depending on whether serum cystatin C (S_cys) 
    is provided:
    
    - Base formula (without S_cys):
        This calculation is based solely on serum creatinine (S_cr) and is less precise than 
        the improved formula but remains a standard for eGFR estimation.
    
    - Improved formula (with S_cys):
        Uses both serum creatinine (S_cr) and serum cystatin C (S_cys), providing a more 
        accurate estimation of eGFR, especially valuable in cases where S_cys data is available.

def dcct_to_ifcc(dcct_hba1c):

    Convert HbA1c from the DCCT (%) unit to the IFCC (mmol/mol) unit.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    dcct_hba1c : float
        HbA1c value in DCCT percentage (%).
        The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) percentage is commonly used in some regions to
        represent glycemic control.
        
    Returns
    -------
    ifcc_hba1c : float
        HbA1c value in IFCC unit (mmol/mol).
        The IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) unit is an internationally
        standardized measure of HbA1c.
        
    Notes
    -----
    The conversion formula is as follows:
    
    IFCC-HbA1c (mmol/mol) = [DCCT-HbA1c (%) - 2.15] * 10.929
    
    This function uses the above formula to convert HbA1c values from the DCCT standard to the IFCC standard.
    
    Reference
    ---------
    The formula is derived from the relationship between the DCCT and IFCC HbA1c standards as defined by the
    International Federation of Clinical Chemistry.
